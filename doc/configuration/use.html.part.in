<h1>use.conf / options.conf</h1>

###PALUDISENVIRONMENTONLY###

<p>On Gentoo and derived distributions, the <code>use.conf</code> file controls which use flags are and are not enabled.
It is a standard configuration file which may be a bash file (<code>use.bash</code>) and which may use the
<code>use.conf.d/</code> directory.</p>

<p>On Exherbo, the <code>options.conf</code> file controls which options are and are not enabled.  It is a standard
configuration file which may be a bash file (<code>options.bash</code>) and which may use the
<code>options.conf.d/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Each line in the file consists of a specification followed by one or more use or option flags and labels. A
specification may be any of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The special specification <code>*/*</code>, which matches all packages. Nearly all users will have at least one
    line using this specification.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>category/package</code> name.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>set</code> name.</li>
    <li>A complex dependency specification.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any token may be quoted using either single or double quotes.</p>

<p>A use flag or label can be:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>flag</code>, which enables that flag.</li>
    <li><code>flag=value</code>, which enables that flag and sets its parameter value. Most flags do not
    use parameters, and so any parameter value specified is ignored. See the <code>BUILD_OPTIONS: jobs</code>
    and <code>BUILD_OPTIONS: symbols</code> flags below for an example of ones that do.</li>
    <li><code>-flag</code>, which disables that flag.</li>
    <li><code>label:</code>, which marks any subsequent flags on that line as applying to a particular use expand
    (Gentoo) or suboption (Exherbo) label. Common examples of use expand labels are <code>VIDEO_CARDS</code>,
    <code>LINGUAS</code> and <code>INPUT_DEVICES</code>, as well as the special <code>BUILD_OPTIONS</code> label
    described below. Labels are <em>not</em> case sensitive.</li>
    <li><code>-*</code>, which disables all flags for the current label, or all flags that are not a label if there is
    no current label.</li>
</ul>

<p>Flag settings are cumulative. This applies to expanded flags too, so if you do not wish to inherit, say,
default <code>VIDEO_CARDS</code> from your profile, you will need to use <code>*/* VIDEO_CARDS: -* radeon</code>.</p>

<h2>Special Flags</h2>

<p>Paludis automatically adds special flags controlling how packages are built. These flags are all in the
<code>BUILD_OPTIONS</code> group. Packages may have any of the following special flags:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>recommended_tests</dt>
    <dd>If set, Paludis will run any 'recommended' tests provided by a package.</dd>

    <dt>optional_tests</dt>
    <dd>If set, Paludis will run any 'optional' tests provided by a package.</dd>

    <dt>expensive_tests</dt>
    <dd>If set, Paludis will run any 'expensive' tests provided by a package. This option should generally
    only be set by package maintainers, since tests marked as expensive are probably too painful in terms
    of CPU time or disk space requirements to run on user systems.</dd>

    <dt>trace</dt>
    <dd>If set, Paludis will ask bash to display extremely verbose information about what an ebuild or exheres is doing
    (using <code>set -x</code>). Not generally a good idea, but can be handy to track down why an ebuild is
    misbehaving.</dd>

    <dt>work</dt>
    <dd>Controls whether Paludis deletes temporary working directories used during the build. If set to
    <code>preserve</code>, the working directory is always kept (and a non-destructive merge is performed). If set to
    <code>tidyup</code>, the working directory is removed after a successful build. If set to <code>remove</code>,
    the working directory is always removed, even after a failed build.</dd>

    <dt>jobs</dt>
    <dd>If set to an unsigned integer, specifies the number of jobs to run in parallel when build systems
    support this (e.g. <code>BUILD_OPTIONS: jobs=4</code> would imply <code>make -j4</code>).</dd>

    <dt>symbols</dt>
    <dd>Controls how debug symbols in executables and libraries are handled. If unset or set to <code>preserve</code>,
    no stripping is done. If set to <code>strip</code>, debug symbols are stripped. If set to <code>split</code>, debug
    symbols are split out into files in <code>/usr/lib/debug/</code>. If set to <code>compress</code>, symbols are also
    split out, and debug sections are compressed. Note that <code>compress</code> will only work with <code>binutils
        &gt;=2.21.51.0.4</code>, and may cause problems with older versions of <code>gdb</code>.</dd>

    <dt>dwarf_compress</dt>
    <dd>Compress the DWARF sections in executables and libraries.  If set, duplicated DIEs are combined into a global
    DIE section and DW_TAG_partial_unit is used to reference the moved DIEs.  Certain DW_FORM_refs may be rewritten if
    they result in a more compact representation.  This option <b>requires</b> the <code>dwz</code> tool to be present
    and in the default <code>PATH</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that these special flags are <em>not</em> use flags from an ebuild perspective. They are used only by Paludis
internals, and are not exported to ebuilds.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
# Accept some basic defaults for all packages, inheriting defaults from profiles
*/* -doc -nls -apache2 bash-completion -gnome -kde mpd flac aac cdparanoia \
  mmx mmxext rtc sse -arts -qt3 -cups real dvd threads dvdnav mp3 quicktime \
  pnm real vidix a52 3dnow 3dnowext amr bidi bl cddb dts srt unicode xvmc

# And set some USE_EXPAND defaults for all packages, explicitly overriding defaults
# from profiles
*/* LINGUAS:           -* en_GB en
*/* VIDEO_CARDS:       -* nv nvidia
*/* ALSA_CARDS:        -* emu10k1

# Some per package settings
app-editors/vim        -perl -python
app-crypt/gnupg        -X
media-sound/lame       -gtk

# And some wildcarding
dev-cpp/*              doc

# We like tests, and don't want debug symbols
*/*                    BUILD_OPTIONS: optional_tests symbols=strip

# But we do want split debug symbols for a few packages
dev-cpp/*              BUILD_OPTIONS: symbols=split

# We want to run four jobs in parallel if possible (Exheres format packages
# only; Gentoo EAPIs use the MAKEOPTS environment variable instead)
*/*                    BUILD_OPTIONS: jobs=4
