<div class="note">
    <p>We apologise for misspelling 'licence' as 'license' throughout. This is done to match the ebuild variable
    'LICENSE', whose name cannot be fixed for Gentoo-based distributions for historical reasons.</p>
</div>

<p>On Gentoo and derived distributions, the <code>licenses.conf</code> file controls which licenses are and are not
accepted. It is a standard configuration file which may be a bash file (<code>licenses.bash</code>) and which may use the
<code>licenses.conf.d/</code> directory.</p>

<p>On Exherbo, the <code>licences.conf</code> file controls which licences are and are not accepted. It is a standard
configuration file which may be a bash file (<code>licences.bash</code>) and which may use the
<code>licences.conf.d/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Each line in the file consists of a specification followed by one or more license symbols. A specification may be
any of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The special specification <code>*/*</code>, which matches all packages. Nearly all users will have at least one
    line using this specification.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>category/package</code> name.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>set</code> name.</li>
    <li>A complex dependency specification.</li>
</ul>

<p>A license symbol can be any of:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>license</code>, which accepts that license.</li>
    <li><code>-license</code>, which unaccepts that license.</li>
    <li><code>-*</code>, which unaccepts all licenses.</li>
    <li><code>*</code>, which accepts all licenses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any token may be quoted using either single or double quotes.</p>

<p>License settings are cumulative. To <em>only</em> accept listed licenses for a given spec, include <code>-*</code> in
the symbols list.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Most users will only want:</p>

<pre>
# Accept everything
*/* *
</pre>
