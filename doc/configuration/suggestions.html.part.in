<h1>suggestions.conf</h1>

@PALUDISENVIRONMENTONLY@

<p>The <code>suggestions.conf</code> file allows suggested dependencies to be automatically taken or ignored. It is a
standard configuration file which may be a bash file (<code>suggestions.bash</code>) and which may use the
<code>suggestions.conf.d/</code> directory. Note that suggestions are not generally used on Gentoo.</p>

<p>Each line in the file consists of a specification followed by one or more tokens. A specification may be any of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The special specification <code>*/*</code>, which matches all packages.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>category/package</code> name.</li>
    <li>A simple <code>set</code> name.</li>
    <li>A complex dependency specification.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lines are considered only if the package containing the suggested dependency matches the specification.</p>

<p>A token may be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A simple <code>cat/pkg</code>, which says to take any suggestions related to the named package. Note that
    complex dependency specifications may <em>not</em> be used here; however, either or both of the <code>cat</code>
    and <code>pkg</code> tokens may be <code>*</code>.</li>
    <li>A suggestions group name, to take all suggestions with that group.</li>
    <li>A minus sign, followed by either of the above, to discard rather than take the suggestion in question.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
# We are always interested in some suggestions from kdevelop:
dev-util/kdevelop dev-util/subversion kde-base/konsole

# We never want some other suggestions from kdevelop:
dev-util/kdevelop -dev-util/cvs

# We don't want any suggestions on kmail from anything:
*/* -kde-base/kmail

# Otherwise, we're interested in all kde-base suggestions:
kde-base/* */*

# We want the send-email suggestions from git:
dev-scm/git send-email
</pre>
