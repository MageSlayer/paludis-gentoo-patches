<h1>mirrors.conf</h1>

###PALUDISENVIRONMENTONLY###

<p>The <code>mirrors.conf</code> file controls where Paludis looks when downloading files. It is a standard
configuration file which may be a bash file (<code>mirrors.bash</code>) and which may use the
<code>mirrors.conf.d/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Each line consists of a mirror name followed by one or more URLs. The special mirror name <code>*</code> can be used
to indicate a mirror that should be tried for all URLs (even those that are marked as 'not for mirroring'). Ebuild
format repositories also treat mirrors whose name is equal to the repository name (or, if the repository has a
master, the master's name) specially, checking them for all mirrorable files.</p>

<p><strong>Usually you do not need a <code>mirrors.conf</code> at all.</strong> The repository-provided defaults are in
most cases perfectly adequate. You generally only specify mirrors if your ISP has a local mirror of certain projects
that provides better download speeds than the default random selection.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
# Try a fast local mirror first
* http://myfastbox/distfiles/

# For mirror://gentoo/, use our ISP's mirror. This mirror will be consulted
# for most files in the 'gentoo' repository, and repositories using 'gentoo'
# as a master, as well as for any explicit mirror://gentoo/ entry.
gentoo http://gentoo.virginmedia.com/distfiles/

# Use a local Debian mirror too. This is only used for mirror://debian/.
