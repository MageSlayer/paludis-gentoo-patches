NAME
----

cave - A commandline client for the other package mangler.

SYNOPSIS
--------

*cave [ --environment class:suffix ] [ --log-level level ] COMMAND [ARGS...]*

*cave help [ --all ]*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The front-end to a number of commands.

For the COMMAND argument, see 'cave help' for a list of common commands, or
'cave help --all' for all commands. To see documentation for a command named
'foo', use 'man cave-foo'.


In addition to built-in commands, cave will also look in the directories named
in the colon-separated CAVE_COMMANDS_PATH environment variable, or, if unset,
'/usr/libexec/cave/commands'. Any executables in this path will also be
available as commands (with any file extension stripped); these executables
may use the $CAVE environment variable to get access to the main cave program.


Arguments specified after the COMMAND are handled by the individual commands.
Arguments before the COMMAND are global arguments shared by all commands.

CORE COMMANDS
-------------

config::
Perform post-install configuration on a package. Note that most packages do
not provide a post-install configuration script.

contents::
Display the contents of (files installed by) a given package ID.

fix-linkage::
Identifies packages with broken linkage that can be fixed by rebuilds. If
instructed, then executes the relevant install and uninstall actions to do
said fixing.

help::
Display help information for a particular command.

import::
Import a package from a directory containing its image. A named directory is
treated as holding the contents to install, and a dummy package name is
provided on the command line. Safe merge, unmerge, upgrade and replace support
is provided, as is content tracking for installed files.

info::
Displays a formatted summary of configuration and package information, e.g.
for use when submitting bug reports. The package names of any relevant
packages for bug reports should be passed as parameters.

owner::
Shows package IDs owning a given file.

purge::
Uninstalls any package that is not either in 'world' or a dependency of a
package in 'world'.

report::
Displays a formatted summary of potential problems with installed packages.

resolve::
Displays how to resolve one or more targets. If instructed, then executes the
relevant install and uninstall actions to perform that resolution.

resume::
Resumes a failed resultion from 'cave resolve'. To enable resumes, use 'cave
resolve --resume-file state --execute', and then if errors occur, use 'cave
resume --resume-file state [ --retry-failed ] [ --retry-skipped ]' to try
again.

search::
Searches for packages with particular characteristics.

show::
Displays a formatted summary of a given object. If the object is a set, the
set's contents are listed. If the object is a repository name, information
about the repository is displayed. If the object is a package dep spec with
wildcards, possible expansions are shown. If the object is a package dep spec
without wildcards, information about matching IDs are shown.

sync::
Syncs repositories. If any repository names are specified, these repositories
are synced. Otherwise, all syncable repositories are synced.

uninstall::
Uninstalls one or more packages. Note that 'cave uninstall' simply rewrites
the supplied dependency specifications and then uses 'cave resolve' to do the
work; 'cave uninstall foo' is the same as 'cave resolve !foo'.

SUPPLEMENTAL COMMANDS
---------------------

dump-cave-formats-conf::
Outputs suitable contents for ~/.cave/formats.conf. This file can be used to
customise the output format for many cave commands (although not commands
designed for script use, such as print-*).

executables::
Display executables belonging to an ID.

fix-cache::
Fixes on-disk caches. Normally this is handled automatically when needed (e.g.
after a sync, or when a package is installed), but a forced fix-cache is
required after a different package manager has been used, or if a repository
is modified without a sync.

generate-metadata::
Pregenerates metadata for a set of IDs.

manage-search-index::
Manages a search index for use by cave search. A search index is only valid
until a package is installed or uninstalled, or a sync is performed, or
configuration is changed.

size::
Shows the size of files installed by a package.

sync-protocol-options::
Displays options for a given sync protocol.

update-world::
Adds or removes items from the world set. This command is only for changing
the contents of the world set; it does not install or uninstall anything.

verify::
Verify than an installed package's files haven't changed. Note that there are
legitimate reasons for some files (such as configuration files) to have been
changed after a merge, and that some packages may install files that are not
directly tracked by the package manager.

DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS
--------------------

digest::
Generates a digest file for a particular package in a particular repository.

mirror::
Fetches files for a set of IDs.

INTERNAL COMMANDS
-----------------

display-resolution::
Displays a dependency resolution created using 'cave resolve'. Mostly for
internal use; most users will not use this command directly.

execute-resolution::
Execute a dependency resolution created using 'cave resolve'. Mostly for
internal use; most users will not use this command directly.

find-candidates::
Finds a list of candidate packages for a search. Used by 'cave search'; not
generally called directly by end users. Note that this command will often
select candidates that do not actually match some of the supplied
restrictions; use 'cave match' to obtain accurate results.

graph-jobs::
Creates a Graphviz graph for jobs in a resolution created using 'cave
resolve'. Mostly for internal use; most users will not use this command
directly.

match::
Determines whether a particular package version has certain properties. Mostly
for use by 'cave search'; not generally for use by end users.

perform::
Perform an action upon a package. Not suitable for direct use, although it may
be useful in some more complex scripts.

ENVIRONMENT
